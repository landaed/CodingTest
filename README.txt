Installation:
run ./make.sh to build the files for part 1
run ./entityMake.sh to build the files for part 2 and 3

Testing:
run ./test to test part 1
run ./build/entityApp.exe ./data/entityblueprints.txt to test part 2 and 3

Note:
I started implementing a binary search tree to help speed up the search for intersections, but I ran out of time to devote to this. It did not end up getting used in the final build.
